DEVOPS-BACKUP

There is a daily job that runs which backs up the database, and the images associated with the app.

The script is ~/app-name/bin/create-backup.tar.sh

It creates a directory, ~/app-name/backup/db, in there, it does a mysqldump of the database. It then
TARs up the ~/app-name dir, and sends it to the backup server, currently RPI1.
