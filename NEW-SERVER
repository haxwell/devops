SERVER FOUNDATION
1. create the new ubuntu based droplet in digitalocean. Pick at least the third cheapest option so you'll have enough resources.
    part of this setup will be giving it your ssh keys. be sure what you have locally is going to this new droplet, so you can connect.

2. ssh root@111.111.111.111 

3. From the DEVELOPER file, follow the instructions for the set of commands to run to get the server foundation in place.

4. log out and copy the ssh from the local machine to quizki on the remote machine

5. run the new-server-install script from the config server.





HAX APP FOUNDATION
After the server foundation is in place, we copy a script from the haxwell devops server, which will lay the foundation for the specific hax app
to be run on the server.

> scp pi@98.245.226.182:/home/pi/haxwell-devops/bin/new-server-install.sh .
> ./new-server-install.sh -n dtim-techprofile -e staging -a 98.245.226.182 -u pi

This runs a general install script, which then calls an application specific script. The environment variables are set in the general script, 
based off of the parameters passed in. The application specific script inherits these when it runs. I think.
