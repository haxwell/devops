DEVOPS-TESTING

A test of the application from a user's perspective, happens every day. 

There is an email sent containing the test reports.

The repo for the ionic app is placed on the server, and there is a script which runs its cypress tests,
using the local server as the backend. See <mobile-app-name>/bin/automated_test.sh
